        <div className='contentStyle'>
          Sometimes people can feel very upset or frustrated when a young pepi
          cries repetitively. It is pepi way of letting their whanau know that
          they need something or that there is something wrong. Never shake a
          pepi and ensure people looking after your pepi don't shake it either.
          It can cause serious head injury in pepi under the age of 12 months.

          Post natal blues is very common. A new mama can feel down and tearful,
          crying for no apparent reason. This sometimes happens in the first
          week after the pepi is born. She can feel worried as there are a lot
          of changes occurring at this time. This feeling passes after a few
          days. However a mama can become more seriously depressed in the first
          months after a pepi is born. This can occur any time within the first
          year after a pepi is born. It maybe difficult for the mama to sleep,
          relax, or make decisions. She may notice changes in her appetite.
          She may also have thoughts of hurting her baby or that life is not
          worth living. These symptoms are able to be treated. It is really
        important to talk to your nurse or doctor and seek help early.
