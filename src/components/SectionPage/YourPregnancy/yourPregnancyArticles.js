        <div className='contentStyle'>
          Maintaining a healthy diet is important when you are pregnant as it
          will help your baby to grow and develop. It is important to eat a wide
          selection of kai to get the right balance of nutrients that both you
          and your baby need.
        </div>
        <div className='contentStyle'>
          Your appetite may change when you are hapu. You may feel hungrier than
          usual or may feel like you don’t want to eat. If you are hungrier than
          normal, eat healthy kai at breakfast, this can help you to avoid
          grazing on kai that are high in fats and sugar as the day progresses.
        </div>
        <div className='contentStyle'>
          Eating kai such as fruits and vegetables provides vitamins, minerals
          and fibre can help with digestion and can prevent constipation.
          Drinking 6-8 glasses of water each day will be helpful in preventing
          constipation also. Ideally, eat five plus portions of fruit and
          vegetables each day. Foods with carbohydrates, such as breads,
          potatoes, cereals, rice, pasta and oats should make up a third of your
          daily kai intake.
        </div>
        <div className='contentStyle'>
          It is important to eat protein kai each day, these can be found in
          foods such as beans, fish, eggs, meat, poultry and nuts. It is
          important to make sure eggs, poultry, meats and pork are cooked well
          through.
        </div>
        <div className='contentStyle last'>
          Kai high in calcium are essential when you are hapu to help your baby
          grow. These include kai like milk, cheese, and yoghurt. Reduced fat
          and lower sugar options are good. For mama that prefer dairy
          alternatives, there are soya options available.

          There are some kai that should be avoided during pregnancy, both mama
          and pepi can be more susceptible to bacteria, viruses and parasites
          that can cause illness and harm to pepi. Some of these foods include
          cheeses made from unpastuerised milk such as brie, blue vein, and feta
          which could contain E.coli and listeria.
        </div>
        <div className='contentStyle'>
          There are certain fish, for example shark, swordfish, big eye tuna,
          orange roughy, and marlin that all have higher levels of mercury, and
          shellfish such as oysters and clams can contain vibrio bacteria. Raw
          and undercooked fish should also be avoided as it may contain harmful
          bacteria. Some salads made in store such as ham salad, chicken salad
          and seafood salad may contain listeria and should not be eaten.
        </div>
        <div className='contentStyle'>
          Kai that are higher in fat and sugar should be limited. Kai higher in
          sugar and drinks (fizzy drinks, energy drinks and fruit juices) can
          contribute to gaining weight and also lead to tooth decay. Fat is high
          in calories and can make you put on additional weight. Some of these
          foods include all spreadable fats (butter), oils, salad dressings,
          cream, chocolate, potato chips, biscuits, cakes, puddings, savories,
          and ice cream.
        </div>
        <div className='contentStyle last'>
          Although you feel that you maybe eating for two, try to have these
          less often and in small amounts. There are some healthy snacks that
          may help curb the appetite. Foods such as small sandwiches or pitta
          bread, salad vegetables, hummus, vege sticks and hummus, small bowl
          unsweetened cereal, fresh fruit, or small baked potato.

          What do you think when you see or hear the word exercise? If you have
          always exercised, that doesn’t have to change because you are hapu.
          You can continue through although you may have to adapt your usual
          exercise schedule. Exercising 3- 4 times a week is ideal. If you have
          not exercised regularly before you became hapu, it is a good idea to
          start a gentle form of exercise such as walking. It can help make you
          feel good during your pregnancy. There are some types of exercise
          activities that are more suitable when you are hapu, these are
          generally low impact or non weight bearing and include exercises such
          as swimming, walking and cycling.
        </div>
        <div className='contentStyle'>
          As time progresses, there are some forms of exercise that can be
          detrimental to pepi. Consider the exercise that you are doing and
          what happens to your body during the exercise. Any exercise that
          rapidly increases your heart rate above 150 bpm and decreases your
          level of oxygen will put stress on pepi. For example after the first
          trimester, it is not good to exercise lying flat on your back as this
          can reduce the blood flow to pepi and cause stress to pepi.
        </div>
        <div className='contentStyle'>
          As time goes on and pepi grows, you will notice your body change and
          also a change in your movement. An increase in body size, looser joints
          and a change in your centre of gravity can result in you being less
          able to move and sometimes off balance. This could mean you are more
          prone to injury or accidents and caution is required. Avoid exercises
          that decrease your level of oxygen such as diving and mountain biking
          should be avoided, or activities that increase the risk of falls or
          trauma to your puku such as netball, horse riding or tennis.
        </div>
        <div className='contentStyle'>
          There are more specific exercises that are important for all mama,
          such as pelvic floor exercises during and after you are hapu. These
          will help to prevent stress incontinence (mimi when you cough or
            sneeze). Talk to your midwife, nurse or GP about suitable exercises
            while you are hapu and after.
